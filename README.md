About Me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian Akabueze, a final-year Mechanical engineering studentðŸŽ“ and self-taught programmer who completed a summer internship at Expedia. Welcome to my Github @fechachris4
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a career where I can solve cool, hard problems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm actively learning and applying programming languages and tools. Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and how to use Python for Machine Learning.

My journey has been marked by a constant pursuit of knowledge, leading me to explore the world of machine learning (ML) and its application in 3D printing for my final year project.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! I look forward to connecting with you.
