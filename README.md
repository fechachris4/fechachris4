MSc Human and Biological Robotics student at **Imperial College London**.

I build practical robotics and AI systems with a focus on:
- **Predictive control**
- **Human-robot interaction**
- **Applied machine learning**

## Current Focus
My current thesis explores **supernumerary robotic limbs**: two 7-DoF robotic arms mounted on a backpack, with predictive control for stabilization under perturbations.

## Background
- MSc: Human and Biological Robotics — Imperial College London
